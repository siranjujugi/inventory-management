# Factory Inventory Management System

A full-stack demo application for a Claude Code workshop — inventory management, order tracking, demand forecasting, and analytics for factory operations.

![Dashboard](docs/dashboard-screenshot.png)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite (port 3000)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI (port 8001)
- **Data**: In-memory mock data (no database)

## Features

- Dashboard with interactive filtering and key metrics
- Inventory tracking across multiple warehouses
- Order management with status tracking
- Demand forecasting with trend analysis
- Backlog monitoring
- Spending analytics
- Budget-based restocking recommendations with submitted-order tracking

## Quick Start

**One-command startup:**
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
# Starts both backend and frontend
# Backend: http://localhost:8001
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

**Manual startup:**

Backend:
```bash
cd server
uv venv && uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints support optional filtering via query params: `warehouse`, `category`, `status`, `month`

- `GET /api/inventory` - Inventory items
- `GET /api/orders` - Orders
- `GET /api/demand` - Demand forecasts
- `GET /api/backlog` - Backlog items
- `GET /api/dashboard/summary` - Summary statistics
- `GET /api/spending/*` - Spending data
- `GET /api/restocking-orders` - Restocking orders submitted during the current server run
- `POST /api/restocking-orders` - Submit an inventory-priced restocking order within a budget

Restocking recommendations prioritize forecast demand and use the inventory catalog for current stock and unit costs. Submitted restocking orders are kept in backend memory for the current server run and appear in the Orders page's **Submitted Orders** section with an estimated two-day delivery lead time.

## Demo Data

Mock data includes:
- Inventory items (Circuit Boards, Sensors, Actuators, Controllers)
- Orders spanning 12 months (Delivered, Shipped, Processing, Backordered)
- Demand forecasts with trends
- Backlog items
- Spending transactions

Data files: `server/data/*.json`

## Production Build

```bash
cd client
npm run build  # Output: client/dist/
```

## Platform Notes

**macOS/Linux:** The one-command startup script (`./scripts/start.sh`) and stop script (`./scripts/stop.sh`) work out of the box.

**Windows:** The shell scripts in `scripts/` are macOS/Linux only. Use the manual startup commands instead — run each in a separate terminal:

Backend:
```bash
cd server
uv venv && uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

To stop the servers, press Ctrl+C in each terminal window.

**Note:** Demo application with in-memory data. Not production-ready without database, authentication, and security implementation.
